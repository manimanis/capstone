# The Eval Project

## Presentation of the Idea

As ***teachers want to evalute their students skills frequently*** they often need tools to do it. Enrolled in a the **Udacity Fullstack Developer Nanodegree** I discovered many new features that can use to build a **Multiple Choice Question exam** tool.

At first glance, the task seems to be easy and obvious. But, after diving in the project I discovered that the project involves more than just coding. I have to make strategic choices about data models, endpoints, frontend coding, unit tests, etc. And, as I advance in the project I discover new things I have not thought of before.

Finally, after working on this project for more than 15 days I decided to send my draft work because I will return to duty very soon I am scare not to have enough time to work on it as it should.

## Presentation of the project

The project is developped using the **Flask framework** for the backend, and **vue.js** for the frontend.
